    <h1 class="m_headings">The International Churches of Christ (ICOC)</h1>
    
    <h2 class="s_headings">Origins</h2>
    <p>The ICOC is a decentralized body of religiously conservative and racially integrated congregations. As of March 2024, it has around 112,000 members. <b>This movement emerged from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_Movement" target="_blank">Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement</a> and began as a discipling movement within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churches_of_Christ" target="_blank">Churches of Christ</a> in the 1970s</b>. <b>Kip McKean</b>, a key figure, expanded the ICOC from Gainesville, FL, to Boston, rapidly growing the church, especially on North American college campuses, from the U.S. into Canada.</p>

    <h2 class="s_headings">Leadership Structure</h2>
    <p>The ICOC has a cooperative leadership model, divided into regional "families," each with its own representatives. The Bible is their sole authority.</p>

    <h2 class="s_headings">Beliefs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Bible is considered the inspired word of God.</li>
      <li>The ICOC aims to restore the "original church" founded by Jesus, claiming non-denominational status.</li>
      <li>They believe that faith alone is insufficient for salvation unless accompanied by baptism, which they view as essential for the forgiveness of sins.</li>
      <li><b>Historically, they held a "One True Church" belief, recognizing only their baptisms as valid</b>. This softened after McKean's departure, with the acceptance of outside baptisms, particularly to <strong>family members who were part of other denominations</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="s_headings">History</h2>
    <p>From the outset, the ICOC embraced principles of the <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/shepherding-movement.html" target="_blank">Shepherding Movement</a> (also called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherding_movement" target="_blank">Discipleship Movement</a>). Key elements included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cell groups and house churches</li>
      <li>Mentoring relationships</li>
      <li>Accountability through mutual submission</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>The movement emphasized authority, submission, discipleship, covenant relationships, and unwavering loyalty</b>.</p>

    <h3 class="s_headings">1970s-80s</h3>
    <p>McKean’s ministry, which began within the movement, saw substantial growth, starting from a few members to over 300 by 1979. He later moved to Boston, agreeing to lead this church under the condition of <strong>"total commitment"</strong> where his church grew from 30 to 3,000 in a decade. He taught that their church was <strong>“God’s true and only modern movement”</strong>, aiming to evangelize the world within a generation under a tightly structured community. The ICOC was known for its extreme views and rigid practices. Despite this, the movement saw rapid growth into the 90s.</p>

    <h3 class="s_headings">2000s</h3>
    <p>Growth had slowed by the 2000s, raising concerns. Leadership issues emerged, particularly about McKean’s leadership style. By 2001, <strong>his children disassociated themselves from the church</strong> and this coupled with questions regarding McKean's moral authority as leader of the movement, led to McKean taking a sabbatical after being pressured, and confessed sins of arrogance and not protecting the weak. <b>His attempts to reassert control were resisted, and in 2006, he was disfellowshipped by the ICOC</b>. He then went on to found the <b>International Christian Church (ICC)</b>.</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kip_McKean#International_Christian_Church" target="_blank">Thomas Wayne "Kip" McKean II</a></strong> was born on May 31, 1954, and as mentioned in the previous section, <b>he is the founder of both the ICOC (from which he was disfellowshipped) and subsequently, the International Christian Church (ICC). He was the former World Missions Evangelist of the ICC</b>.</p>
      <p>McKean graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in Speech and Communications and later attended Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary. He left due to a two-way dispute, vexed by their liberal views on the Bible while they were concerned about his strict personal style. He then attended Harding Graduate School of Religion, from which he never received a Master's degree.</p>
      <p>His negative academic experience, combined with success as an evangelist, convinced him that seminary education was ineffective at training evangelists. This led him to create a "discipleship" approach modeled on his earlier mentoring pastor Chuck Lucas and the Bible.</p>
      <p>After being <b>disfellowshipped from the ICOC in 2006</b>, he published on <strong>October 15, 2006</strong>, the Portland church bulletin, the first of a three-part series called "Partners in the Gospel". These articles were the first formal announcement of the birth of the ICC, leading affiliated churches in Portland to change their name to the "ICC".</p>
      <p><b>In April 2007</b>, he, his wife Elena, and 40 other leaders left the Portland ICC to plant the City of Angels ICC in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p><b>In 2012, the <i>International College of Christian Ministries (ICCM)</i> was founded</b>, offering Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctorate Degrees <b>based on the SoldOut Movement's (Kip McKean's) convictions, and not accredited by any Department of Education</b>.</p>
      <p><strong>In late 2022 to early 2023, McKean was named as a defendant in several federal lawsuits alleging that the ICOC and the ICC "covered up sexual abuse of children as young as three years old and financially exploited church members"</strong>. These lawsuits were withdrawn by the plaintiffs and replaced by 4 Los Angeles Superior Court cases with similar accusations. <b>Here are the case details: <a href="https://icoc-icclawsuits.com/" target="_blank">(Case Nos. 23STCV16423, 23STCV16430, 23STCV18426, and 23STCV24432)</a></b>.</p>
      <p><b>As of April 29th 2024, Kip McKean retired from being the World Missions Evangelist of the ICC with reasons being "faltering spiritually"</b>. <a href="https://rohnfamilyadventure.com/kip-mckean-05-2024/#:~:text=Kip%20McKean%20has%20retired%20as,of%20the%20International%20Christian%20Churches." target="_blank">Here</a> you can find more details on that, including a video delving deeper into the reason why, which I urge you to watch.</p>
