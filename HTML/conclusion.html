    <section>
      <p>As we reach the end of this journey through this website together, in hopes you traversed it in chronological order,
       I want you to take a moment to reflect on everything that was discussed on how each section was built upon the previous. 
       <strong>It is essential to consider the ideas that may have been implanted in your mind about
       "persecution." and the teachings you received saying persecution will come your way.
       I ask you to think back on our time together: <i>have I ever attempted to hurt you or take
      any action that would have been detrimental to you?</i> Should the answer be "no", ask 
      yourself then "If for more than a year he has not, why would he start now?"</strong>.
       This comes purely from a place of genuine care and concern.</p>
      
      <p>To understand what was going on, I had to do my own research.
      <strong><i>How then can I stand by and say nothing, knowing all what I have learned from this research? Would you have said nothing to me if the roles were reversed?</i></strong></p>
          <blockquote class="testimony"><i>"Neutrality is at times a graver sin than belligerence." -Louis D. Brandeis</i></blockquote>
      <p>I firmly believe it is vital for you to have knowledge of all this as you walk your spiritual path.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
      <p>I want to express that I am open to dialogue. If you want, and feel comfortable,
      I invite you to discuss your thoughts and feelings. Additionally, even though I was  
      already firmly rooted in my faith, I noticed it grew. To effectively carry out 
      this research and put together this site, I had to reconnect, in my own way with God by 
      means of personal prayer, attending mass and discussing with some Catholic priests
      at the parish about questions I had about things I found and was unsure of while
      performing this task. Gladly, they expressed openeness to having you come and discuss this,
      should you be open to it. Just as you required I be open to coming to your church even once,
      and hearing what they had to say and interact with the people there.</p>
      
      <p>Again, I am not trying to force you into anything; I am simply presenting my findings. It is entirely up to you to read, reflect, pray, and decide for yourself.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
      <h2 class="s_headings">Prayer Request</h2>
      <p>At this time, I ask that you pray once again. Pray for <b>an open heart</b> to 
      take in and accept the things revealed within this site. <b>Open-mindedness</b> to 
      accept them all as presented, without refusal to see them as they are. Pray then 
      for <b>wisdom</b> and <b>discernment</b> to be able to judge for yourself each aspect 
      fairly, and for <b>God's guidance</b> to help you with this task. Pray for 
      <b>patience</b> to not hasten yourself into rash decisions. Finally, pray for 
      <b>courage</b> to permit you to act as need be.</p>
