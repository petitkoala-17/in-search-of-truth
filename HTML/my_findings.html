                      <blockquote class="testimony"><b>"I wanted to take some time to warn any Christian students on campus about the dangers of this cult. If you aren’t Christian or religious this still may help you either way.
I will be talking about my experiences with this cult to give everyone an idea of what they are like and what they do."</b></blockquote>
                      <blockquote class="testimony">"I was part of the ICC. Indeed, they are a cult. Do not be afraid of them and be straightforward with them. I was in leadership and the disgusting things I saw and went through I wouldn't wish that on anyone. They're on almost all college campuses because they know young, vulnerable people are there. They say young people are easy to mold, meaning easy to manipulate."</blockquote>
                      <blockquote class="testimony">"And yes, the International Churches of Christ/International Christian Churches are very sneaky. There are many who thought they were just checking out a Bible study or joining some non-denominational church only to find out they joined one of those two churches."</blockquote>
                      <blockquote class="testimony">"Felt something was wrong, prayed about it, and it was revealed in the third study what they really believe. Stood up for my faith in Christ and His sound doctrine. There was a lot of cherry picking verses to fit their cult's religion and were so hyper focused on the physical baptism which is only just a proclamation of one's faith in Jesus Christ, not the provision for salvation (dismissing the power of Jesus's blood). It was disheartening because I now see why cults like this hurt people and can twist God's word. What they were teaching was not a loving relationship with God, but more of this unhealthy fear like if you do not do xyz (works or in this case, the work of baptism) then God is going to punish you which again is completely false (1 John 4:18)."</blockquote>

                      <blockquote class="testimony"><b>"To clarify, I’m not in leadership and I don’t plan on ever “stepping up” to be. I’m just a regular member who was baptized a few years ago. I plan on leaving the church as soon as God opens another door for reasons I can explain if asked."</b></blockquote>
                      <blockquote class="testimony">"What made me leave was the fact that “stepping up” is an inevitability that is expected of every member. For all intents and purposes, it’s a startup church that needs its every member to “step up” in some capacity. Whether it’s serving as an usher, singer, mercy ambassador, kids kingdom, discipler, Bible talk leader, then going a little higher deacon of something, evangelist/WML etc. it’s a need that needs to be filled and somehow someway you will be “encouraged” to step into these roles and refusal to do so means “you have weak faith” or that “you need to trust God more”.</blockquote>
                      <blockquote class="testimony">"“I know your deeds; you are neither cold nor hot. How I wish you were one or the other! So because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to vomit you out of My mouth!” ‭‭Revelation‬ ‭3‬:‭15‬-‭16‬ ‭BSB‬‬ -you have to be fully committed or not at all for your faith’s sake. Your faith in God that is, not in the church. But obviously, in this church, faith in God and faith in the church is synonymous. Which in that line of thinking, if you doubt the church you’re already doubting God. I don’t agree. You made Jesus Lord not Kip not your leader not the person who baptized you. This is the faith that needs to be solid - faith in God."</blockquote>

YES, we should be baptized as commanded, but every time she spoke of salvation as we discussed theology it was “well he was baptized”… “full Emersion” she asked me what I thought salvation was and I told her John 14:6 says Jesus is the only way and Romans 10:9 says if we believe and confess we are saved by grace. I also shared with her a man in our old congregation who could not be immersed due to being on a medical device that helps him breathe so they laid him back and poured it on his head…. and she said “well that’s for God to decide” WHAT? He believes!"

A self-described Protestant, he had always yearned for a student organization where he could practice his beliefs while studying at California State University, Fullerton. However, he couldn’t have known that his almost-two-year experience with the ICC would forever change his understanding of the faith."
