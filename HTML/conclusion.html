<section>
    <p>As we reach the end of this journey through this website together, I encourage you to reflect on everything we've discussed and how each section built upon the previous one. 
       <strong>It is essential to consider the ideas surrounding "persecution" and the teachings you received about it. 
       Think back on our time together: <i>Have I ever attempted to hurt you or acted detrimentally towards you?</i> 
       If your answer is "no," ask yourself: "If he has not done so for over a year, why would that change now?"</strong> 
       My intentions stem from genuine care for you.</p>
      
    <p>To understand what was going on, I had to do my own research. 
       <strong><i>How could I stay silent after what I've learned? Would you have remained silent if our roles were reversed?</i></strong></p>
       <blockquote class="testimony"><i>"Neutrality is at times a graver sin than belligerence." - Louis D. Brandeis</i></blockquote>
    <p>Your awareness of this knowledge is crucial as you navigate your spiritual path.</p>

<section>
    <p>I want to express that I am open to dialogue. If you want, and feel comfortable, I invite you to discuss your thoughts and feelings. 
       Additionally, even though I was already firmly rooted in my faith, I noticed it grew. 
       To effectively carry out this research and put together this site, I had to reconnect, in my own way, with God through personal prayer, attending mass, 
       and discussing with some Catholic priests at the parish about questions I had regarding things I found and was unsure of while performing this task. 
       They expressed openness to having you come and discuss this, should you be open to it, just as you required I be open to coming to your church and hearing what they had to say.</p>
      
    <p>Again, I am not trying to force you into anything; I am simply presenting my findings. 
       It is entirely up to you to read, reflect, pray, and decide for yourself.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 class="s_headings">Prayer Request</h2>
    <p>At this time, I ask that you pray once again. Pray for <b>an open heart</b> to take in and accept the things revealed within this site. 
       <b>Open-mindedness</b> to accept them all as presented, without refusal to see them as they are. 
       Pray then for <b>wisdom</b> and <b>discernment</b> to be able to judge each aspect fairly, and for <b>God's guidance</b> to help you with this task. 
       Pray for <b>patience</b> to take the time needed for thoughtful decisions. Finally, pray for <b>courage</b> to act as need be.</p>
