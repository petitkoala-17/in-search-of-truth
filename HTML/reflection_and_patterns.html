      <h2 class="s_headings">Reflection Questions</h2>
      <p>In hopes that you have come to this page after reading the previous 
         content in a chronological manner, I wish to ask you to now take some 
         time to reflect. During this reflection of all what you have read, 
         and watched, I ask that you ask yourself these following questions:   
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>How was I first approached by the ICC? Did they seem unusually friendly or insistent?</li> 
          <li>Was there any sense of urgency in their invitation?</li>
          <li>What was my state of mind and appearance (sad, distressed, moody?) that week, and on the day I was approached
            (the answer to this question was revealed on September 22nd when you said you were having a rough week, but reflect
            again on it.)
          </li>
          <li>What was their attitude when they first invited me? Was/Has the group been presented as the only true way to faith or salvation by their words/teachings or any other means?</li>
          <li>Was I suddenly made to feel special or chosen, and how did this affect my perception of things?</li>
          <li>Have there been any patterns of controlling behavior? Have I been encouraged to limit or cease contact/interactions with family, friends or loved ones outside the church?</li>
          <li>Am I gradually feeling pressured to spend more time with members of the ICC?</li>
          <li>Were there any subtle or direct hints to change my lifestyle? Have they suggested changes in how I dress, speak, or behave?</li>
          <li>Have comments been made, directly or indirectly about my job, school, or hobbies, especially in the modeling area where I am exposed to perceived "outsiders"?</li>
          <li>Am I feeling pressured to contribute financially or with my time? Were contributions voluntary, or was there any pressure to give more than I was comfortable with?</li>
          <li>How do I feel after attending all the events, meetings and accountability tasks?</li>
          <li>Do I feel uplifted, or do I feel drained, pressured, micromanaged, scrutinized or any other way? Has there been any change in self-esteem, especially if "ICC standards" are not met?</li>
          <li>Are there inconsistencies between what is taught and what is practiced? Do I genuinely feel that leaders hold themselves to the same standards they ask of others?</li>
          <li>What are my genuine personal thoughts, and feelings, after all I have read and listened to from this site?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="s_headings">Red Flags to Look Out For</h2>
      <p>These patterns may be signs of manipulation or control. Reflect on whether you've encountered any of these:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><b>Pressure to Cut Off Family and Friends:</b> Have I noticed them discouraging relationships with those who aren't members of the ICC or being asked to cut-off people if they refuse to join?</li>
          <li><b>Micromanaging Personal Choices:</b> Have they tried to control what I wear, how I spend my time, or who I associate with?</li>
          <li><b>Sacrificing Jobs, Hobbies, or Education:</b> Has there been pressure to prioritize church activities over my work, hobbies, or studies? Have I been asked or suggested to sacrifice or completely let go of any such things?</li>
          <li><b>Financial or Time Pressure:</b> Are they urging me to commit to contributing money or time, beyond what feels comfortable or rationally feasible for me to go about my life and fulfill other obligations?</li>
          <li><b>Punishing Doubts or Questions:</b> Do I feel uneasy asking certain questions or expressing doubts? Are those who challenge the church marginalized or ignored?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have noticed any of these, I urge you to take action to set boundaries and observe their reactions. If you have not, I also urge you to be on the look-out for these in the near future.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="s_headings">Difficult Questions to Ask the ICC</h2>
      <p>You have always mentioned my love for the question <b>"why?"</b>. Now, I encourage you to <strong>gather the courage
         to ask "why?"</strong>, to those in positions of eldership and leadership within the ICC. These questions below 
         will help you gauge their responses and observe their demeanor towards you once you show signs of thinking differently
         from the group.   
      </p>
      <p>This will permit you, by their responses, to observe if they become defensive, dismissive, and how they begin viewing and treating you. I will even suggest you write their answers down (do not be scared of this! as they may likely discourage you from doing so, but you must stand firm) to further reflect on them on your own, in a calm state of mind to see if they make logical sense.</p>
      <ul>
          <li><b>"Why is it so important that I distance myself from people who aren't part of the ICC? Did Christ not mingle with gentiles and those considered sinners (<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/116/mat.9.10" target="_blank">Matthew 9:10-12</a>, <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/116/luk.15.1" target="_blank">Luke 15:1-2</a>)? Does the Bible not teach us to 'love thy neighbor as thyself' (<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/116/mrk.12.31" target="_blank">Mark 12:31</a>)?"</b></li>
          <li><b>"What do we do of <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/116/mrk.12.31" target="_blank">Mark 12:31</a>: <i>'And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.'</i>"</b></li>
          <li><b>"What are this church's thoughts on the salvation of the thief on the cross, who was a sinner, clearly not part of the church or a follower of Christ at the time, yet was promised heaven for believing in Jesus while on the cross beside him?"</b></li>
          <li><b>"Is there room for different interpretations of Scripture, or is the ICC’s interpretation the only valid one (and why)?"</b></li>
          <li><b>"Can you explain why certain activities or hobbies are discouraged or seen as less spiritual?"</b></li>
          <li><b>"Why are we called 'the true kingdom of God' or similar names? What authority grants us that designation?"</b></li>
          <li><b>What do we make of other churches that have stood the test of time over millennia? Do we discard their works and miracles that occurred within them?</b>
          <li><b>"How does the ICC handle doubts or disagreements from members?"</b> Notice if their response makes you feel like independent thinking is welcomed or discouraged.</li>
          <li><b>"What happens if someone chooses to leave the church? Does that mean they will also lose their salvation?"</b> Their response could indicate how much they try to control people’s decisions.</li>
          <li><b>"Why are members expected to sacrifice financially or with their time?" (mention the man from the Sunday service of September 22nd who said he was encouraged to quit his job to attend service) and (also the advice given to give everything and 'not worry about what we shall eat or wear'). Ask if they believe that to be sound advice in this economy and why wasn't he advised to act as in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%206%3A5-6&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew 6:5-6</a>?"</b> Which states:</p>
          <blockquote class="testimony">"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 6 But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."</blockquote>
          <p>Observe if the emphasis is more on spiritual growth or on loyalty and contribution to the group.</li>
          <li><b>"Have people left this church? Why did they leave?"</b> Here, observe if the people are painted as "non-believers", or made to seem evil in general and shunned.</li>
          <li><b>"Why is it so important that my sins be shared with others? As a Christian, can I not sincerely confess and ask God for forgiveness of these sins through Jesus Christ, in prayer?"</b></li>
          <li><b>"Why was the church founder Kip McKean" disfellowshipped from the ICOC, and why did he also resign from leadership position here in the ICC in April (be specific with the dates)? How EXACTLY did he falter?</b> You should have the answers to these questions from the video in his section. Asking this is merely to see how they will act and respond, and <b>it is a very important question</b>.</li>
          <li><b>"How does the ICC determine who is considered a 'true Christian'? What criteria is used, and does that mean those outside the ICC are truly not saved?</b></li>
          <li><b>"What safeguards are in place to ensure that the teachings of the ICC align with scripture? How can members challenge teachings they believe are incorrect?"</b></li>
          <li><b>If the ICC believes the Bible to be the sole authority, how then do you reconcile the phrase 'peak where the Bible is quiet and be quiet where the Bible speaks'? Does this not create room for personal interpretations or agendas that may not align with Scripture?"</b></li>
          <li><b>"What does the ICC believe happens to members who 'fall away' from the church? Are they not 'saved' anymore if they chose to go elsewhere or foster their relationship with God on their own?"</b></li>
          <li><b>Why are we encouraged to report our sins to each other/our discipler? Will God not forgive us these sins we have if we directly, and with a remorseful heart confess them to him and seek forgiveness through the grace of Jesus Christ?"</b></li>
          <li><b>"Why is it often emphasized that we seek counsel from the church rather than external sources? What are the potential consequences of seeking guidance outside the ICC?"</b> This will permit you to see their stance on autonomy and the influence they wish to have over member's decision-making.</li>
          <li><b>"What is the ICC doing about the current lawsuits that have been brought against them</b> Here, emphasize that you are aware they have not been dismissed as they will try to claim, <b>press for <i>a concrete and logical answer</i>, as this is another important question</b>.</li>
      </ul>
