  <p class="details">I created this site because <b>I care deeply about you and your
    journey.</b> I know you are seeking something extremely important and meaningful, and
    I respect that. What I have enclosed in this site comes from plenty of time taken
    to perform the necessary research and understanding required, and me sharing it
    with you at this time <b><i>is not in an attempt to persecute you, as you may be misled to believe</i></b>. I
    sincerely hope you will <i>take the time to reflect on these findings</i>.
  </p>

  <p class="details">I wish that you understand everything enclosed in this site is
    <b><i>not</i></b> with the goal of questioning your faith, but rather
    to ensure you have all the tools and information to make the best decisions for
    yourself. <b><i>I sincerely want to support you in your growth</i></b>, and this as a whole
    has also led to plenty of growth on my part. So, this website is my way of doing
    that.
  </p>

  <p class="details">I understand that some of what you will find written here
    may be hard to read, and you might, not to say "definitely will" feel defensive
    at times. That is normal, and okay. All I ask is that you read through everything
    with the same open-mindedness, discernment, and patience that I know you have.
  </p>

  <p class="details">I understand that even though I have taken the time to do
    this, ultimately it is up to you to make a decision. I want you to know that
    I am not asking that you immediately choose sides, but to take 
    everything in, and make the necessary decisions with full understanding and
    awareness.
  </p>

  <p class="details">You will find different sections on this website, each
    dealing with various aspects of my study and research.
    I urge you to <b>display patience and follow it chronologically using the navigation
    buttons at the bottom of each page, as the content builds upon itself, with each
    section preparing you to better understand the next in sequence.</b>
    However, if you wish to jump to any specific section, you can use the links below.
