                <p>
I want to let you know that I have read the "First Principles Study" in its entirety, to fully understand what the teachings of the ICC are. In this section, I aim to offer a breakdown of each study, highlighting similarities I’ve found between these teachings and cult-like practices based on my research. <b>Each section will focus on one study, providing a breakdown, comparisons, verses that may offer different perspectives, and some thought-provoking questions</b>.<br>
My goal is to show you that I’ve taken time to understand their teachings and to help you thoughtfully navigate through these concepts. <strong>While all sections are important, I especially encourage you to explore the "Sins (Anger & Resentment)" study, as I believe it holds particularly valuable insights that could resonate deeply with you</strong>.

                        <p>
                            The introduction and "set-up for the study", when read on a deeper level, are seen
                            to aim for the indoctrination of individuals rather than fostering open conversation.
                        </p>
                        <p>I wish to draw your attention to the fact that <i>each study is set-up to establish
                        non-Christian status and thus push the individuals towards acceptance of the ICOC/ICC
                        as truth and long-awaited savior</i>.</p>
                        <p>In addition to this, there is a recurring use of selective scripture
                        interpretation and emotional manipulation, along with the fact that their
                        denominational affiliations are not disclosed until late into the study.
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, there is the presence of a manipulation of consent
                        by narrowing down the individual's options to fuilt-trip them 
                        into feeling they need to absolutely join the group to obtain
                        salvation. This is extremely detrimental, especially if the 
                        individual is in an emotionally and spiritually vulnerable state 
                        at the time of this initial conversation.</p>

                        <p>Reframing of discussions to erode an individual's existing
                        beliefs and make them feel inadequate in their faith.</p>
                        <p>A well-thought and elaborate approach towards dismantling
                        the individual's belief, which is often seen in cult-like
                        strategies where individuals are systematically broken down
                        especially mentally.</p>
                        <p>A very recurring theme of making the individual believe AND
                        depend on the group's interpretation of faith.</p>
                        <p>A clear hidden agenda is seen, by not disclosing their denomination
                        until late in the study, reflecting tendencies of avoiding skepticism
                        until a strong bond is formed with the individual.</p>

      <h3 class="ss_headings">1. Breakdown</h3>
      <p>Emphasizing the idea that everyone is either in darkness 
        or in light creates a dichotomy that may lead individuals to 
        feel judged based on their perceived sinfulness. <strong>However, the Bible itself
        contains nuances and gray areas that complicate such black-and-white thinking.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>For example, in the listing of specific sins in <i>Galatians 5:19-21</i>, which <i>in hindsight I understand why it repeatedly came up in our conversations</i>, it is used to prove this point.</p><br>
      <p>Galatians 5:19-21 lists <b>drunkenness</b> as a sin, leading some to claim that Christians should not drink alcohol at all. However, <b>Jesus' first miracle in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202%3A1-11&version=NIV" target="_blank">John 2:1-11</a></b> celebrates its use in joyful, appropriate settings.</p>
      <p><b>Paul also advised Timothy to use wine for his stomach ailments</b> in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%205%3A23&version=NIV" target="_blank">1 Timothy 5:23</a>, which states:
        <blockquote class="testimony">"Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses."</blockquote>
        <p>This proves that the sin mentioned in Galatians refers to <b>excess and loss of control, not the mere consumption of wine itself</b>. The Bible promotes balance and discernment, not rigid extremes.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Another example: When Jesus heals a crippled woman on the Sabbath in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2013%3A10-17&version=NIV" target="_blank">Luke 13:10-17</a></b>, it was seen as breaking Sabbath laws by the Pharisees, who had a black-and-white approach. Jesus highlighted that freeing this woman from suffering took priority over rigid legalism, showing a gray area.</p><br>
      <p><b>Marriage and divorce:</b> Jesus taught that divorce was permitted in the time of Moses due to the hardness of people's hearts, but it was not intended from the beginning. It is allowed in cases of infidelity (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019%3A8-9&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew 19:8-9</a>), and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%207%3A10-16&version=NIV" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 7:10-16</a> provides another gray area: allowing divorce if an unbelieving spouse chooses to leave the marriage.</p><br>
      <p><b>War and killing:</b> In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%206&version=NIV" target="_blank">Joshua 6</a>, God commands war, yet in the Ten Commandments, we are told not to kill. Similarly, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022%3A35-36&version=NIV" target="_blank">Luke 22:35-36</a>, Jesus tells his disciples to carry swords, but later in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026%3A52&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew 26:52</a> he advises against their use.</p><br>
      <p>From these examples, we learn that the Bible does not operate in absolutes, but in balance. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%203%3A1-8&version=NIV" target="_blank">Ecclesiastes 3:1-8</a> states it best:
        <blockquote class="testimony">"There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens: a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot... a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak..."</blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>Dealing in absolutes creates fear of judgment for failing to conform, pushing members to strictly adhere to agendas hidden behind doctrines.</p><br>
      <p>The notion that everyone has sinned (which is true) diminishes individuality and fosters collective guilt, setting up the next part of recruitment.</p>
      <p>The group teaches that sin separates one from God, and salvation can only be found within them, reinforcing urgency for redemption <b>through the group</b>.</p>
      <p>Using examples like "worldly vs Godly sorrow" manipulates emotions, creating fear and obligation to change, often not from genuine belief but from fear of consequences.</p>
      <p><b>The challenge to pick a baptism date</b> at the end of this study instills urgency, pushing individuals to make quick decisions without considering their family or long-standing friends.</p>

      <h3 class="ss_headings">2. Similarities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pushing for quick decisions without consulting people "outside the group".</li>
        <li>Shaming and instilling fear to present the group as the sole solution.</li>
        <li>Creating a shared identity among members, reinforcing salvation through the group.</li>
        <li>Encouraging members to constantly prove their worth to the group, fostering dependency and fear.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="ss_headings">3. Refuting Bible Verses</h3>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/116/gal.5.1" target="_blank">Galatians 5:1</a></b> states:</p> 
      <blockquote class="testimony"><i>"Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."</i></blockquote> 
      <p>This verse refutes the imposition of legalism and church-imposed rules that enslave believers.</p>

      <p><b><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/116/rom.5.1" target="_blank">Romans 5:1</a></b> discards the pressure that ongoing works or confessions to the church maintain a believer's standing with God.</p>

      <p><b><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/116/1ti.2.5" target="_blank">1 Timothy 2:5</a></b> tells us:</p>
      <blockquote class="testimony"><i>"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus."</i></blockquote> 
      <p>This refutes the need for confessing sins to "disciplers" or leaders for salvation.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/116/rom.6.14" target="_blank">Romans 6:14</a></b></li>
        <li><b><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/116/2co.3.18" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 3:18</a></b> explains that spiritual growth and repentance are gradual processes led by the Spirit, not immediate changes imposed by external pressure.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>At this point, I urge you to question yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>As I confess my sins to this fellow sinner, what guarantees do I have that my sins will not be used against me?</li>
        <li>Are they under any oath to keep these confessions private?</li>
        <li>Why can I entrust these people, whom I barely know, but not my family, loved ones, or God directly through Jesus Christ?</li>
        <li>If I fall out with these people, am I comfortable knowing they could tarnish my reputation out of spite?</li>
      </ul>

                              before deciding to follow Jesus and be baptized by them.

                          <p>In this study, there is also plenty of emotional manipulation taking 
                              place, as the focus is pointed to how feelings can "blind one spirtiually"; 
                              reinforcing fear, AND DOUBT in the recruit's mind, as to what they know is 
                              right, or their core beliefs which they previously held.
                          </p>

                          <p>Evidently enough, the idea of <b>persecution</b> is brought up in this 
                        study <i>to make it seem as though any outside thoughts or exterior/self questioning 
                  they may be asked or have is of an inherently evil nature</i>. <strong>Here, they are 
                  also urged to cut-off these potential "sources of persecution". This is all in

                   <p>We can also see in this study, that the group, and discipler teaching the recruit 
                        at this point makes more bold moves to cut them from the exterior world, as <i>they 
                        are encouraged to exclusively date within the group</i>. How detrimental this is, will
                        be brought up in subsequent sections of this site.

                   <p>All in all, up to this point they have laid out the conditions needed for new 
                        recruits to be baptized, which if not met, baptism, and therefore salvation will be 
                        witheld.

                          <p>The first thing to notice in this study is there are no new 
                              iterations from the ICOC 1990 version, and so one can safely 
                              assume this is the teaching still being used.
                          </p>
                          <p>The next thing to notice here, is <b>the reiteration of the claim 
                              that they are the "one true church"</b> as this is a question to be asked, followed 
                              by a prompt to ask the recruit and ensure that should they move, they will 
                              only join one of their branches.
                          </p>
                          <p>Commitment to the congregation is emphasized, including: devotions, meetings, 
                              seminars, fellowship time, encouragement dates, and group activities among others.
                          </p>
                          <p>Willingness to make Jesus and his church (in this case the group; ICOC/ICC) 
                              the first priority in the individual's life, to even sacrificing friends and 
                              family <b>(once again watering the seed of a possible "persecution" to come 
                              whereas it is simply, genuine questioning of the beliefs they propagate and 
                              habits/patterns they have)</b>.
                          </p>
                          <p>Again, a recurring theme as with other studies that comes up 
                              is that of <b>getting the recruit to gradually commit to abandoning 
                              all personal responsibilities and commitments, putting them to the 
                              side or at the very least into the hands of the group</b>. This is seen 
                              as <b>the playbook calls for the discipler to get the recruit to commit 
                              to "excel in school work/school" BUT without making it a priority, and 
                              "God's guiding hands" in regards to their relationship life here being 
                              the decisions of the "leaders"</b>.
                          </p>
                          <p><b>The illusion of choice</b> is prevalent in this section. This is seen when 
                              asked if ready to contribute to the church, and a base rate of 10% is 
                              mentioned as ideal, and beautifully-clothed with the words "but it 
                              is between you and God". <b>Of course this is psychological, no one will 
                              want to go below the recommended amount, and the window is open for

                          </p>
                          <p>Submissiveness, yes! once again, submissiveness, not to God, but to 
                              "church-leadership" who in their self-proclaimed righteousness are 
                              all-knowing of what will be best for the individual. Thus stripping them 
                              of any autonomy (which will progressively go further in the future).

                              ask yourself</b>: <ul>

                                    <li>What does "give-up-anything" entail? Me giving up these things, 
                                    is it being decided by God, or by a fellow man in a position of "leadership"
                                    who claims to know what is best for me over family/friends who have cared and 
                                    nutured for me all my life, or even my own critical thinking?

                          <p>The question "who is/isn't a Christian?" leads the recruit to believe that there 
                              are multiple definitions to who a Christian is BUT that their specific church alone 
                              holds the true definition, and without joining, one cannot truly be saved. Fostering

                          <p><b>FACT! Christ's role in everyone's life is of the upmost importance.</b> How then is this 
                              presented to the recruit in a harmful way, one may wonder?
                          </p>
                          <p><ul>
                              <li>Emphasis on frequent meetings and establishment of structured follow-up 
                                    system to create dependency on the group and its leaders for validation.
                              </li>
                              <li>Emphasis to openly discuss sins with fellow men and women, sinners, fosters 
                                    a culture of constant accountability to these people, not GOD,
                                    which potentially leads to coercion and/or manipulation.
                              </li>
                              <li>The call to have members of the church as "best friends" (after having made 
                                    the individual cut off exterior family ties and/or friendships) enforces 
                                    isolation, and heavy dependence on the group.
                              </li>
                              <li>Discouraging the questioning of church authority, as it may be attributed to 
                                    one "fighting against God". This effectively put the individual in a postion 
                                    to not want to be seen as such, and effectively suppreses personal thought, or 
                                    seeking exterior input on topics.
                              </li>
                              <li>The presentation of "The Mission" as some great battle against persecution, 
                                    as already mentioned is simply to close-off the mind of the recruit to 
                                    potential future questioning and exchange of diverse idea or opinions. 
                                    This fosters group identity, and creates a "martyr mentality" which the 
                                    individual should rely on, rather than be open to hearing others.

            <p>In this section, the only sins I will focus on are those of 
                <b>"Hatred"</b>, also termed "quarrels" in the document
                and <b>"Discord"</b>, also termed "strife/contentious temper". 
                My focus is on these two because they were brought up 
                during our September 21st conversation. 
            </p>
            <p>"Forgive and forget" is a common phrase used these days, 
                and even though it is not explicitly worded as such in 
                the Bible, the following verses point to that:
                <ul>
                    <li><b><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/PSA.103.12" target="_blank">Psalm 103:12</a></b></li>
                    <li><b><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/MIC.7.19" target="_blank">Micah 7:19</a></b></li>
                    <li><b><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/PRO.19.11" target="_blank">Proverbs 19:11</a></b></li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>I ask that you pause, question yourself, and take time to find and even write down the answers to these questions for yourself:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is keeping me attached to feelings of anger and resentment even after an issue was addressed and agreed to move on from?</li>
                    <li>Is this anger and resentment due to feelings I did not express, or words I chose to withhold?</li>
                    <li>What held me back from expressing my feelings or communicating what I needed to say before agreeing to settle the misunderstanding and move forward?</li>
                    <li>What did I experience in the past that made me fearful of opening up or trusting?</li>
                    <li>What do I fear will happen if I express my feelings and needs?</li>
                    <li>Why do I have a hard time trusting this person? Have they shown me they are untrustworthy before?</li>
                    <li>How do I expect them to know, if I do not say how I feel, and what I need?</li>
                    <li>How do I plan on building strong and fulfilling relationships without opening up?</li>
                    <li>Why am I fearful of being vulnerable?</li>
                    <li>What if I faced my fears and committed myself to expressing my emotions and needs to see how beautiful things could actually be?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>I believe growth often comes from facing our fears and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable. As we explore these feelings together, I hope you can see the potential for deeper connection and understanding in all aspects of life.</p>
            <p>Reflecting on our experiences can lead to profound personal growth. It is important to recognize that every relationship has its challenges, but it is how we navigate those challenges that helps us grow stronger.</p>
            
            <p>In any given relationship—family, friends, lovers, colleagues—there will always be quarrels and discord of some form and degree. There is no relationship without these things ever occurring. In the case of lovers, my research led me to find that these <b>relationships always have 3 phases</b>.</p>
            <p>An initial phase after just meeting the person, where the spark is bright and everything is bliss. A second phase, where after some time together, flaws and shortcomings begin to appear, leading to conflict (anger/resentment), and this is where these kinds of relationships are either made or broken. For those that reach the third phase, there is a mutual understanding of who they are with and how to navigate the relationship, making it just as beautiful, if not more so, than it was at the start. You can read more about these 3 phases with the links below:</p>

                          researching allowed me to gain a deeper understanding, present this breakdown, draw out the similarities, and 
                          provide relevant verses. My hope is that this exploration leads to greater insight and clarity for both of us.
