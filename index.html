  <p class="details">Hello! I hope all is well with you. It makes me glad to know that
    you decided to follow the link and access this site.
    Herein, you will find multiple pages, each of them dealing
    with separate aspects of my findings, as well as personal thoughts on everything
    going on. I believe that if you were moved to come here and see for yourself what
    lies within, it was for good reason.</p>

  <p class="details">With this first step having been made, I now ask that you please
    approach and navigate this site with an open mind, to fully read, listen, and
    understand what is found within it. I also ask that you take time to answer the
    questions you will find within this site on a piece of paper. This will make it 
    easier to stay on track and reflect on them at the end. Finally, it will be up to you to draw your
    own conclusions. All I can do, <i>as someone who greatly cares for you</i>, is to bring
    forth the things I have found.
  </p>

  <h2 id="request/prayer" class="s_headings">Prayer Request</h2>

    judge adequately things that are yet to come regarding this current predicament.
