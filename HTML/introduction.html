  <p class="details">I created this site because <b>I care deeply about you and your
    journey.</b> I know you are seeking something extremely important and meaningful, and
    I respect that. What I have enclosed in this site is the outcome of plenty time taken
    to perform the necessary research and understanding required, and me sharing it
    with you at this time <b><i>is not in an attempt to "persecute" you, as you may be misled to believe</i></b>. I
    sincerely hope you will <i>take the time to reflect on these findings</i>.
  </p>

  <p class="details">I wish that you understand everything enclosed in this site is
    <b><i>not</i></b> with the goal of questioning your faith, but rather
    to ensure you have all the tools and information to make the best decisions for
    yourself. <b><i>I sincerely want to support your growth in this area, as previously expressed</i></b>, and this as a whole
    has also led to plenty of growth on my part. So, this website is my way of doing
    that for the time being.
  </p>

  <p class="details">I understand that some of what is enclosed here
    may be hard to read and you might, not to say "definitely will", feel defensive
    at times. That is normal, and okay. All I ask is that you read through everything
    with the same open-mindedness, discernment, and patience that I know you have.
  </p>

  <p class="details">I understand that even though I have taken the time to do
    this, ultimately it is up to you to make a decision. I only ask that you take
    the time to take everything in, reflect deeply, and make the necessary decisions
    with full understanding and awareness.
  </p>

    section preparing you to better understand the next in sequence.</b>
